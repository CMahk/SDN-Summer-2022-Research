# SDN 2022 Summer Research
## Introduction
This is a repository for my NC4 research while working with the DoD

The focus of this research is to find better solutions for SDN resilience, specifically when using ONOS controllers

This repository includes the following:
* An environment setup script
* Scripts to create multi-controller instances and various functionalities for them
* Wireshark packets displaying how quickly controllers discover failed instances
* A BFD script to be installed on Mininet switches, with additional scripts to help configure test enviroments using the BFD module
